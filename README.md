✅ Scalable and Lightweight – Built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Pandas for fast and efficient analysis.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
NLP Techniques: Tokenization, TF-IDF, Stopword Analysis
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression
Version Control: Git & GitHub
📖 How to Use

🔧 Installation
1️⃣ Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/gowthamikota/Veritas.AI.git  
cd Veritas.AI  
2️⃣ Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt  
3️⃣ Run the classification script:

python backend.py  
4️⃣ Input a text sample and get a prediction on whether it’s AI-generated or human-written!

📊 Results & Insights
AI-generated text often has limited variation in vocabulary and specific word usage patterns.
Human-written text contains more diverse sentence structures and stopword distributions.
The models achieved high accuracy in distinguishing AI vs. human content, reinforcing the effectiveness of NLP-based analysis.
